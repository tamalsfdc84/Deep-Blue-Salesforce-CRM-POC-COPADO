      <p><strong>Electronic Documents and Signatures - Consent. </strong>North Capital Trust Bank and its affiliated companies*
        (hereinafter collectively referred to as "Companies," "we" or "us) are required or allowed to provide you with certain written
        disclosures, documents and information pertaining to your transactions with us ("Required Information"). </p>
      <p>Under the federal <strong> E-SIGN Act</strong> and related state laws, with your consent, we can deliver such Required Information to you
        electronically and can use electronic records and electronic signatures in connection with your transactions with us. Therefore,
        please review the terms of this Electronic Consent Agreement prior to giving your consent, and retain a copy of this Electronic
        Consent Agreement for your records. </p>
      <p>If you do not want to receive the Required Information electronically, or do not want to use electronic signatures in connection
        with your transactions with us, you should not agree to the terms of this Electronic Consent Agreement. If you do not consent to
        receiving the Required Information electronically, or do not consent to the use of electronic signatures in connection with your
        transactions with us, we will not be able to proceed with the acceptance and processing of your transaction or online account
        services. </p>
      <p>If you want to proceed with your loan application via the Internet, you must consent to receiving the Required Information
        electronically before we can provide it to you electronically. Your consent will apply to all your transactions with us and any
        Required Information we provide or make available to you. Your consent also permits the general use of electronic records and
        electronic signatures in connection with all your transactions with us. </p>
      <p><strong>Required Information You Will Receive Electronically. </strong>By providing your consent under this Agreement, you agree
        that Companies may provide you with the following Required Information solely in electronic form:
      <ul>
        <li>Any contracts, documents, or disclosures required by law or provided by Companies, including, without limitation, any loan or
          insurance disclosures, documentation, statements and other transaction-related communications and disclosures. </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p><strong>Paper Copy of Required Information Available Upon Request - No Charge. </strong>If you consent to receive the Required
        Information electronically, you can also request a paper copy of the Required Information by contacting us, by phone, at (800)
        290-7002. We will not charge you any fees for providing a paper copy of the Required Information. Your consent does not mean that
        Companies must provide the Required Information electronically - only that they may do so. Companies may, at their option, deliver
        Required Information on paper, if they choose to do so. Companies may also require that certain communications from you be delivered
        to Companies on paper at a specified address. </p>
      <p><strong>ACH Disbursement. </strong>If you consent to proceed with this transaction electronically and provide your bank routing and
        account number, you consent to the electronic disbursement of any and all loan proceeds directly to your bank account via Automated
        Clearing House transaction. </p>
      <p><strong>Withdrawing Your Consent. </strong>You may withdraw your consent to receive Required Information electronically or to the
        use of electronic signatures in connection with any future transactions with us at any time. Any withdrawal of your consent will be
        effective only after we have a reasonable period of time to process your withdrawal, which may take up to 10 business days. We will
        not charge you any fees for withdrawing your consent. If you decide you do not want to receive Required Information electronically,
        or do not want to use electronic signatures in connection with any future transactions with us, you may withdraw your consent by
        contacting us, by phone, at (800) 290-7002. </p>

        you at the e-mail address you have provided to us. If you change your e-mail address, you must provide your new e-mail address to us
